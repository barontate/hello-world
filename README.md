# hello-world

Hi there,

My name is Tate, and I'm still new to the whole DevOps thing.
I've an Adv. Dip. in Computer Systems Engineering and am one year into a Computer and Software Systems Degree at the University of Melbourne (AU).

I also enjoy cosplaying after my namesake, Tater Tos. 

Am currently interning in IT Sec between semesters.
